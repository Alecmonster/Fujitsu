					<h2>Understanding GDPR</h2>
					<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is already having a deep impact on the way all organizations manage data privacy. GDPR has global reach. It protects the data of all EU subjects regardless of where you collect, store or process it. It requires that you strengthen data privacy controls, ensure the technology you use to manage personal data is fit for purpose, and that you can supply detailed, documented, responses to requests for data. And that’s just the start.</p>
					<p>Our mission is to enable you to understand the regulation and turn it to your advantage.</p>

						<h2>GDPR and you</h2>
						<p>Despite the headline penalties, fear should not drive your response to GDPR: it’s an opportunity to transform your data governance and management; and to boost productivity and efficiency. You can also unlock the true value that your data represents to drive customer engagement and build trust in your people, processes and brand.</p>
						<p>Data privacy is about people and their rights. Your rights and the rights of your stakeholders. So, that’s our starting point.</p>
